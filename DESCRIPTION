Title: Inverse-Propensity-Weighting for Partially Nested Designs
Version: 0.1.1
Author: Xiao Liu
Maintainer: Xiao Liu <xliu19@nd.edu>
Description: Use inverse-propensity-weighted estimation approaches to estimating the treatment effect from a partially nested design where one study arm (the treatment arm) is nested and the other study arm (the control arm) is not. Two estimators are provided: IPW mean difference and IPW multilevel modeling. <https://github.com/xliu12/IPWpn>.
